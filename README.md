# laboratory-works-Python-2020
this is a repo for all laboratory works I coded on Python as a part of my educational process at LPNU IoT 1st course.

### lab 1 : class usage
> create a class *Hotel* with 6 fields. add a default constructor and destructor. add a method that returns a string representation of the class. add a static field and a static getter for it. initialize 3 class objects and output their fields in main method.

### lab 2 : testing
> code all the construction goods subclasses in accordance with the UML diagram created as a part of lab 2 (see [laboratory-works-Java-2020]). use doctesting to call sorting and searching methods. edit the code in accordance with PEP8 and create right packages for each class group. do not make fields private, protected etc. if they were so on the diagram.

### lab 3 : rest
> implement a *REST* service with *CRUD* operations (*Get/Post/Put/Delete*) for one of the class from lab 2 (better create another one) using *Flask* and *SQLAlchemy*. 

### lab 4 (bonus) : regular expressions
> write a program that prints unique website addresses with error requests between 03:35 AM and 03:55 AM 01/Jul/1995. all the requests are listed in a logfile, which is located [here]. use a regular expression to find matching lines.
